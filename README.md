# **PinPals**

PinPals is a modern golf-matching app designed to help golfers connect more easily. Users can create a profile, see golfers nearby, match based on skill level and availability, and coordinate rounds at local courses. The app makes it simple to find partners for 9 holes, 18 holes, competitive play, or casual practice.

This repo contains a simple landing page for the project.
